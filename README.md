# Repository for test code for the Lee Yang Zeroes flow method

## Main files

File name | Description
--------- | -----------
Makefile  | Standard makefile, hopefully platform independnt
lyz_pythia.C | The main code of interest, this code uses pythia to generate events and then do LYZ analysis
recursion_pythia.C | This code is secondary for now, it uses the Recursion algorithm to look at k-particle flow correlators (and cumulants)

## Papers directory
Some of the key papers of interest to understand the theory behind the method
